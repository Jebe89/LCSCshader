# LCSCshader
LCumashader(for Umamusume) variant for THE iDOLM@STER Shiny Colors Song for Prism texture input

Unlike the in-game effect in the closet, this shader uses the classic Lambert Term for lighting.

Remember to set the shade texture's warp mode to clamp.

Dont use any experimental option, its currently broken and is pending for fix.

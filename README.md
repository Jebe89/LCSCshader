# LCSCshader
LCumashader(for Umamusume) variant for THE iDOLM@STER Shiny Colors Song for Prism texture input

Unlike the in-game effect in the closet, this shader uses the classic Lambert Term for lighting.

Be aware that the dynamic hair shine function remains unstable and use it wisely, any idea on it is welcomed.
